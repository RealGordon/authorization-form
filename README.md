# Authorization Form

## Background
A client just called to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see.

They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form.

## Project
In this project, I hid their website’s contact page behind a password form by using a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.

*correct password*: **swordfish**
